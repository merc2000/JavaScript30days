    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age=20;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age,age2);

    age=21;
    console.log(age,age2);//once the value is set even if the value of age is changed it does not affect age2

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team=players;
    console.log(players,team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3]='Lux';
    console.log(team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players);
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    let team2=players.slice();


    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let team3=[].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let team4=[...players];

    let team5=Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed


    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
          //const captain=person;
          //captain.number=99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain=Object.assign({},person,{number:99,age:29});
    console.log(person);

    // object ...spread
    const captain2={...person};
    captain2.age=40;

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const mer={
      name:'Merrin',
      age:20,
      social:{
        github:'merc2000',
        instagram:'mercthedev'
      }
    }

    const dev=Object.assign({},mer);
    dev.social.github='devgit';
    console.log(mer);

    //instead do like this or find a function for deep clone from the internet
    const dev2=JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));//JSON.stringify(wes) will convert it to a string and then we do JSON.parse() that will convert it to a object and forget all the references
